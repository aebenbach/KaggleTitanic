Modeling the survival of the Titanic's passengers for Kaggle's competition

This project creates predictions for Kaggle's ML Titanic
competition. A logisitc regression model is used to predict the survival of passenger's of the titanic. Also included are
visualizations of various demographics and their survival rates.

The guiding rationale for the model is the following: women and children were prioritized by the crew filling
lifeboats. The higher class tickets were on the upper decks and were able to make
it to the lifeboats in time. Families that were too large became encumbered
and could not make it.

The model recieved a score of .78 for predicting survival of passengers in the test data. Ranking it in the top 19% of submissions.
