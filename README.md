Modeling the survival of the Titanic's passengers for Kaggle's competition

This project creates a predictions for Kaggle's ML Titanic
competition. A logisitc regression model predicts the survival of passenger's of the titanic. (1 = survived)

The guiding rationale for the model is the following: women and children were prioritized by the crew filling
lifeboats. The higher class tickets were on the upper decks and were able to make
it to the lifeboats in time. Families that were too large became encumbered
and could not make it.
